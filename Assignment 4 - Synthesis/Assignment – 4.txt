Assignment 4Agneya A. KerureSound 1: This sound tries to reflect a mind under a lot of pressure and stress. There is always something going on. Time is always ticking and the sounds around the “time-rhythm” suggest chaos and inevitable doom.Patch Architecture: 1. This patch uses Karplus Oscillators with high decays. The excitation impulses drawn on each oscillator are made to sound like small noisy glitches2. The main “time-rhythm” is represented by the hand clap which also has a high decay. The Q value is set low to give maximum noisiness.3. The Gigaverb glues all the oscillators together to make a cohesive chaotic sound. The reverb time and size is kept very high to create the desired effect.4. The oscillators are driven by triggers generated by a rotating clock divider which is driven by a metro. The timing is played with randomly but the hand clap trigger is played at a constant rate to create the desired effect.Sound 2: This sound tries to reflect a mind which is bored. Time passes slowly and randomly. There is no sense of purpose. The silences indicate contemplation.Patch Architecture: 1. This patch uses Karplus Oscillators with high decays. The excitation impulses drawn on each oscillator are made to sound like short tonal bursts.2. The main “time-rhythm” is represented by the hand clap which also has a high decay.3. The reverb time and size is kept very low to create the desired effect of “boredom” and to reduce the chaos in the sound but keep it glued together.4. The oscillators are driven by triggers generated by a rotating clock divider which is driven by a metro.This sound has bursts of silences interspersed with rhythmic tones.
